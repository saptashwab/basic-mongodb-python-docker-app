# basic-mongodb-python-docker-app

This is a simple app to demonstrate the use of Python and Flask to create REST APIs, HTML and CSS to create a webpage and Javascript to use the REST APIs to exchange data with the back-end. The database being used is MongoDB. All of this is packaged using docker to help run the application.

To run the app, just navigate to the folder where the project is in the terminal, and execute the following: `docker-compose up`

Please note that the application uses 8000 port on the host machine, and nothing should be running on that port.
